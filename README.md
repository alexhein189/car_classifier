# car_classifier
An image classification model made from the Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images.
The losses and accuracies are plotted on the notebook. 

I learnt the conceptualisations of CNN by correctly calculating images sizes through the convolutional layers. 

This is the kaggle I used:
